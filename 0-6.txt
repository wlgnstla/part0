The following is a diagram depicting when a user creates a new note in the single page version of the app.

note over browser:
    js has even handler if new note is created
    note is converted into an object
    that object gets run by SendToServer() function
    which says if the POST request was successful,
    hence, our JSONified note makes it over to the /new_note/spa
    it will console.log("message created")
end note over 


browser->server:HTTP:POST request to /new_note_spa address
server->browser:{"message":"note created"}
